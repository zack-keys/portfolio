  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>Every now and then I get to take a break from UI work and illustrate a new label for one of the seasonal PicoBrew PicoPaks. Depending on the time and theme this can be anything from interesting Photoshop techniques (see Grand Master Mash) to fully rendered illustrations inside of Clip Studio (Shankill). Regardless of the approach, it's inevitably a fun project to tackle and a nice change of pace.</p>
