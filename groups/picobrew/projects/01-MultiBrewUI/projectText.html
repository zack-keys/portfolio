<h1>MultiBrew Prototype UI</h1>

  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>As part of a physical prototype for an experimental Pico machine I got to design a UI flow for two different brewing operations â€“ one for Craft Beverages like Chai and another for single-serve coffee. One of the main goals of this UI was to illustrate the physical process taking place in the machine as the brew progressed, while still having it readable at the relatively low screen size of 240x320. We also had to have an image-rich experience while working within extremely tight memory constraints due to the board the system was using at the time.</p>

    <p>My solution was a system that was sliced in such a way as to emphasise reusability of assets and used clean illustrations for the brewing UI that could be compressed to the small sizes needed for the project.</p>
