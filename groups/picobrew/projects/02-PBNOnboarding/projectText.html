<h1>PBN Service Pitch</h1>
<!--<hr />-->
<div class="projectText">
  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>PicoBrew rolled out a new program for homebrewers that allows them to publish their beer recipes directly to the PicoBrew Marketplace and be sold as PicoPaks. As part of that rollout, we needed to created a simple, focused webpage that not only pitched the service as a whole, but provided a smooth onboarding process for homebrewers who aren't currently using PicoBrew hardware.</p>
