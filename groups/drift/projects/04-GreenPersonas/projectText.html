    <p>This was a fun side project the product team at Drift knocked out during a particularly slow week. I worked with our front-end engineer who had written the quiz to build a set of illustrated animal personas to represent the true nature of the person behind the answers. I was just thrilled to have the chance to draw a puffin with a monocle.</p>
