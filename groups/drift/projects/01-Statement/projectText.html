  <div class="projectBio">

    <p>As part of a legal argument Drift was making to an energy board in NYC we had to come up with a concept of what our billing UI would look like when our product was fully implemented. The focus was on showing that a Drift user would be able to do the important things like managing their account, and that through the UI we could grant them deeper insight into the kind of power they were buying, exactly what it was costing them, and where it was coming from.</p>

    <p>The argument was ultimately successful and this visual concept helped sell people on the idea of Drift and provided a roadmap for the product design team as we continued to build the product.</p>
