    <p>Some of the most exciting work at Drift was my collaboration with the leadership team as they worked through ideas for new products. My job was to participate in brainstorming sessions and then translate all of the ideas brought up into a storyboard-like visualization of the idea that we could show to our partners and ask the all-important question --- "Does this look like a tool you'd want to use?"</p>

    <p>The goal for the property sim was to provide an easy way for non-technical users in charge of multiple properties to find ways to save money and reduce their environmental impact.</p>

    <p>After a simple upload process, they could access a specific node and see real-time forecasts of savings and environmental impact as they added or removed property modifications like smart thermostats, battery storage, or a membership with a local solar project. Once they locked in their choices Drift would work with our partners to make those property modifications happen and then allow the user to easily implement those same changes across other properties in their network.</p>
