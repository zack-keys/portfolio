  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>Over spring break the Web Team at the UW iSchool wanted to solve a long running problem. Over and over they found themselves in need of a well-branded, easy to set up Drupal template for websites requested by researchers, staff, and faculty at the school. This template would need to scale from barely any content on a single page to a multi-page site with a basic blogging system and cover everything in between.</p>
    <p>My initial duties covered the visual design for a template but about halfway through it was decided that we needed to put a friendly face on the system to help sell it to our constituents. Thus, Bento was born. The full system is expected to launch in early 2017 with a site (built with Bento) that provides basic content guidelines and an on-boarding tutorial that will assist users with the process of setting up content for placement in the final site.</p>
