  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>I was approached to design an identity for a recently formed cleaning coalition in Highlands, NC. When the initial meeting took place they had yet to decide on a name and requested that I develop it along with the visual elements of the brand. They had already gained some local fame for wearing vibrantly decorated aprons while they were working and it had become a sort of accidental trademark for their group. Some clients began referring to them as “the girls with the aprons” and it stuck. <em>Les Femmes</em> won out, playing off their nickname and harkening back to an older, more exacting, standard for housekeeping.</p>
