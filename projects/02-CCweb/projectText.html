    <p>For this project I collaborated with Jacob Sutton on the brand for his new agency, Creative Campfire. The mark and supporting visual elements that we created reflect the tone of his work, the environment that he operates in, and our joint love of topographical maps. The Website would need to do the same.</p>

    <p>The major focus of the design was to build something that people would want to explore and interact with. Smooth transitions and an interesting visual presentation were key which led us to a final design that opens to reveal new projects and adapts the site-wide color palette to support each individual portfolio entry.</p>
