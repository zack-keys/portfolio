    <p>I was approached by author Brian Railsback who was looking for someone to handle the layout of his slightly-less-grim than most post-apocalyptic novel, <em>A Going Concern</em>. Along with the interior layout and cover illustration I helped him setup distribution through Amazon's print-on-demand and Kindle  platforms, giving him the keys to a fully set-up publishing avenue at the end of the project.</p>
