  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>This project revolved around creating a sub-brand for the Fine Art Museum at Western Carolina University. They wanted something that would distinguish the museum as a distinct entity within the larger body that is WCU and allow for them to have a strong voice for promotional campaigns in the future. The final mark plays off the distinctive architecture of the Bardo Arts Center where the museum is housed.</p>
