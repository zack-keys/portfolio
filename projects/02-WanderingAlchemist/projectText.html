  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>Once, in the snow-wracked land of Cape Cod, there was a man by the name of John Crowley III. This man found himself in dire need of an ally as he set out on a quest to improve the lives of Dungeon Masters everywhere. He found that ally in the form of a designer – Zack Keys, of Seattle.</p>

    <p>Together they forged a sigil that would carry John’s message to the deepest corners of the Internet. Illuminating darkened hovels where broken DMs wept under the onslaught of questions like “Why CAN’T I roll a Drow Sorcerer/Druid/Paladin/Warlock with a pet Beholder?”.</p>

    <p>Then they captured the visage of the fearsome Chaugnar Faugn and made some podcast artwork out of it. That was pretty cool too.</p>
