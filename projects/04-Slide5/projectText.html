  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>This mark was built for Cataloochee Ski Resort (Maggie Valley, NC) for a training program called “Slide in Five”. Its goal was to provide new skiers with the training and the equipment they needed to pursue their new hobby all in one package. The mark was to be applied in vinyl to all of the gear given out at the end of the course and needed to be easily recognizable in either the classic orange and blue of Cataloochee or in a simple single-color application. The result was a simplified take on Cataloochee’s shield mark with clean typography that could brand without overwhelming the items it was applied to.</p>
