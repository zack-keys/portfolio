    <p><em>Simha</em>, a blog focused on promoting mindful living, approached me to rebrand them under a new name, <em>Donâ€™t Lose The Cow</em>. Along with the visual refresh they were also expanding their blog's offerings to include a network of writer/practitioners who would operate autonomously; a branding document was created to help onboard these new collaborators.</p>
