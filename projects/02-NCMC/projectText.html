    <p>The North Carolina Museums Council wanted a new brand heading into 2015. Working alongside one of their curators I designed a mark that was inspired by the heavy use of glass in North Carolinian art culture and the need for an adaptable identity that wouldnâ€™t overwhelm the art it framed.</p>
