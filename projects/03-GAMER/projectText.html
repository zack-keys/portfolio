  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>With a growing interest in the academic study of video games the Game Research Group at the UW Information School found themselves in need of a solid visual identity. One that could help them stand out anywhere from the building where they reside to conference speaking opportunities abroad.</p>
    <p>The approach we came to is a multi-mark identity where every researcher in the group has their own version of the primary hex shape. As new researchers come on board new versions of the mark will be developed for their personal materials and added to their workspace via a vinyl application.</p>
