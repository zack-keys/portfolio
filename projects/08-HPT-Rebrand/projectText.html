  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>Haywood Public Transit in Western North Carolina was looking for a new mark to represent a refreshed brand direction heading into 2015. They approached my good friend Jacob Sutton and he, in turn, asked if I would like to collaborate on the mark. The proposed design is flexible, with a basic geometry that lays a sound foundation for the vehicle wraps that will adorn the fleet that serves the Haywood County community.</p>
