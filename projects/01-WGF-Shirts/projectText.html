  <div class="projectBio">
    <p>Early in 2015 I partnered with WannaGofast Racing to design a series of shirts for their Half-Mile Shootout events that take place across the country. Since the partnership began weâ€™ve finished a selection of designs that include event-specific limited editions and a retro-inspired shirt for the brand as a whole.</p>
